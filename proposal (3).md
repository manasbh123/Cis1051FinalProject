# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

BST Sneakers

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks."

This will be a website where users are allowed to buy, sell, and trade sneakers.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Users will make an account to be apart of the community and when they do they can look for sneakers they like. The program shows a list of matching sneakers, along with their prices and seller ratings. The user can then buy the sneakers and get it shipped to their homes. If a user wants to sell sneakers they can list the sneaker on the website by showing photos and a description. The program uses a variety of techniques, such as comparing the sneakers to a database of well-known fakes or requesting purchase documentation from the seller, to confirm the sneakers' authenticity. When a user purchases the sneakers, the seller receives the payment and ships the sneakers to the user.

For trading sneakers, a User creates a list of sneakers they want to trade by including photos and a description. The computer program connects the user with other users who are interested in trading for the sneakers that the user has listed. Users agree on the details of the trade, including which sneakers will be exchanged and any additional payments necessary to maintain the trade's value. If a deal is agreed on, the website will make the exchange and any extra payment if necessary.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Michael Balogun: Yihan & Xinwen Zhang - tuq74299@temple.edu
Michael Lowe: Yihan & Xinwen Zhang - tup08129@temple.edu

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I hope to accomplish a stable site that can at least show the corrrect prices for sneakers and a place where users can navigate easily.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think we can accomplish a site that functions well with users being able to make transactions.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome will be a site that can easily buy,sell, and trade sneakers without conflicts.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The next steps is to research into libraries that can help us find correct prices of sneakers and authenticity of sneakers. We will need to first start by coding a well functioned website that will first allow users to create an account and browse for shoes. A lot of research will be needed in terms of coding a way to make purchases, allow users to communicate, and fidning the right way to update websites. We still need to decide who does what but we will collaborate on the coding.
